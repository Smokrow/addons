        "This notebook gives a brief introduction into the [normalization layers](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/master/tensorflow_addons/layers/normalizations.py) of tensorflow addons. Currently supported layers are:\n",
        "* **Group Normalization**\n",
        "* **Layer Normalization**\n",
        "* **Instance Normalization**\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind these layers is to normalize the output of a activation layer to improve the convergence during training. In contrast to [batch normalization](https://keras.io/layers/normalization/) these normalizations do not work on batches, but they normalize the activations of a single sample, making them suitable for recurrent neual networks as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "Typically the normalization is performed by calculating the mean and the standard deviation of a subgroup of you input tensor. It is also possible to apply a scale and an offset factor to this as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "$y_{i} = \\frac{\\gamma ( x_{i} - \\mu )}{\\sigma }+ \\beta$\n",

        "as the spatial axes (Height and Width of a picture for example). The pixels in blue are normalized by the same mean and variance, computed by aggregating the values of these pixels.\n",

You can activate these factors by setting the `center` or the `scale` flag to `True`. Of course you can use `initializers`, `constraints` and `regularizer` for `beta` and `gamma` to tune these values during the training process. \n",
