        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind these layers is to normalize the weights in a network layer to improve the convergence during training. In contrast to [batch normalization](https://keras.io/layers/normalization/) these normalizations do not work on batches, but they normalize the weights of a layer. \n",
        "\n",
        "Typically the normalization is performed by calculating the mean and the standard deviation of a subgroup of you input tensor. It is also possible to apply a scale and an offset factor to this ass well.\n",
